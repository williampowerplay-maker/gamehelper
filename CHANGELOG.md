## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-14 (Retrieval Bug Fixes — 87% Query Pass Rate)

### RAG Retrieval Fixes (session 13)
- **Query pass rate**: 13/15 (87%) on test battery, up from 6/15 (40%) at session start
- **Root cause 1 — Stale cache poisoning**: "No info" responses cached before game8 ingestion were being served for 7 days. Cleared 14 stale cache entries via SQL DELETE. Going forward: clear negative-response cache after major content ingestions.
- **Root cause 2 — Keyword boost too broad**: URL-match boost searched with single-word terms (e.g. "necklace") that matched every necklace page; `limit(10)` returned 10 wrong-necklace chunks at synthetic sim=0.88, outscoring correct White Lion Necklace vector results at sim=0.575. Fix: when multi-word phrases are available, use ONLY those for URL matching.
- **Root cause 3 — Keyword boost ignoring content_type filter**: Fextralife exploration/quest chunks (containing "ancient ruins") were added to puzzle search results at synthetic sim=0.88, outscoring correct game8 puzzle chunks at real sim=0.67. Fix: apply same `content_type` filter to all keyword boost queries (URL-match and content-ILIKE).
- **Build query classifier**: "Best build for X" previously filtered to "mechanic" only, missing item/character chunks with equipment stats. New BUILD classifier fires before all others and returns `null` (no content_type filter) so all content types contribute to build recommendations.
- **Commits**: `2b17bbb` (keyword boost fix), `c6132b9` (build classifier fix)

### Debugging Note
- Discovered model mismatch bug in manual testing: using `voyage-3-large` to test similarity against `voyage-3.5-lite` stored embeddings gives near-zero similarity scores (false alarm). Always use the production model when debugging.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-13 (Security Hardening + Retrieval Fixes)

### Security (session 12)
- **CRITICAL FIX — API key exposure**: Removed `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `VOYAGE_API_KEY` from Next.js `env` block in `next.config.ts`. The `env` block statically inlines values into the client-side JS bundle — these keys were visible to anyone reading page source. Server API routes access them via `process.env` (Vercel) and `loadEnv()` (local dev).
- **Security headers**: Added `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Strict-Transport-Security` (2yr), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and `Permissions-Policy` to all routes via `next.config.ts`.
- **Rate limiting tier bypass fix**: Rate limits were derived from client-controlled `spoilerTier` body param — anyone could pass `spoilerTier:"full"` to get premium rate limits (60/hr Sonnet). Now hardcoded to `"free"` for all unauthenticated requests.
- **Input length guard**: Questions capped at 500 chars — prevents prompt stuffing and inflated Voyage embedding costs on large inputs.
- **Admin auth hardening** (all 3 admin routes): Replaced `!==` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing attacks. Added failed-attempt throttle: max 5 failures per IP per 15 minutes.
- **Admin export type allowlist**: Explicit `["waitlist", "users"]` allowlist — rejects unknown `?type=` params.
- **`/api/log-error` rate limit**: 10 submissions/IP/min to prevent DB flooding via this unauthenticated endpoint.
- **Supabase RLS policies updated**:
  - `error_logs`: Added INSERT policy — logging was silently failing (RLS enabled with no policies = all writes denied)
  - `queries SELECT`: Removed `user_id IS NULL` branch — anonymous query history was publicly readable
  - `knowledge_chunks`: Restricted INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to `service_role` only — anon key can no longer inject fake content
  - `page_hashes`: Restricted all operations to `service_role` only
- **Ingest scripts**: Switched from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — required after knowledge_chunks RLS tightening

### RAG Retrieval Fixes (session 12)
- **Query pass rate**: 10/12 (83%) on Reddit-style test set, up from 3/10 (30%) at session start
- **Grappling retrieval**: Fixed — URL-match boost now fires on single words ≥7 chars (e.g. `grappling`) not just multi-word phrases; grappling skill pages now score 0.88 similarity floor
- **Fast travel retrieval**: Fixed — system prompt now explicitly documents Abyss Nexus = fast travel system
- **System prompt game systems block**: Added key mechanic bridging notes (fast travel = Abyss Nexus, grappling move list, silver/gold bar currency) so Claude answers correctly when chunk text doesn't use exact query phrasing
- **Classifier**: Removed `gold bar/silver/currency` and `best X` patterns from `item` filter — these queries now do full unfiltered search since the info lives in `beginner-guides` (mechanic content_type), not item chunks

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-10 (Guides Ingestion, Retrieval Quality Pass)

### Content
- **3 new categories ingested** — 21,276 chunks total:
  - `beginner-guides` (`/New+Player+Help`, deep crawl) — 16,238 chunks from 1,154 pages. Covers fast travel, early-game gear, consumables, ruins, New Game+, trophy guide, inventory slots, and hundreds of location/NPC/quest pages discovered via deep BFS.
  - `grappling` (`/Grappling`) — 1,608 chunks from 110 skill pages. Full grappling move set: Restrain, Throw, Lariat, Giant Swing, Aerial Grapple, Screwdriver, Back Hang, plus all Kliff combat skills and the Blinding Flash skill page.
  - `game-progress` (`/Game+Progress+Route`) — 3,430 chunks from 212 pages. Includes Abyss Nexus (101 chunks, fast travel), New Player Help (64 chunks), Game Progress Route (166 chunks), How to Get More Inventory Slots, New Game Plus, Trophy and Achievement Guide.

### RAG Retrieval Fixes (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Nudge tier chunk count raised 2→4**: With 38,000+ chunks in the DB, 2 chunks was too narrow a retrieval window. 4 chunks gives grappling, fast travel, and mechanic queries enough candidate slots to surface the right content. Token budget unchanged (100 max tokens, Haiku model).
- **Mechanic classifier additions**: Added `fast travel`, `fast-travel`, `travel point`, `abyss nexus`, `traces of the abyss` — "how do I unlock fast travel" now routes to mechanic correctly.
- **Item classifier additions**: Added `gold bar`, `gold bars`, `silver`, `currency` keywords. Added `best (weapon|armor|gear|build|loadout)` to `getItemPhrases` — "best armor for early game" now routes to item correctly.

### Cache Maintenance
- Cleared 6 stale bad cached responses from `queries` table: `how does grappling work`, `explain the grappling system`, `how do i get gold bars`, `best armor for early game`, `how do i unlock fast travel`, `what does blinding flash do`. These were cached before the new content was ingested and would have returned wrong answers for 7 days.

### Reddit/Real-World Query Testing
Ran 10 real player queries against production. Results before fixes: 3/10 pass, 3/10 partial, 4/10 fail. Key findings:
- ✅ Boss queries (Lucian Bastier, Reed Devil) worked reliably with lowercase informal phrasing
- ✅ Abyss Artifact location query worked well
- ❌ Gold bars, grappling, fast travel, best armor all failed — missing content
- ⚠️ "Best weapon" and vague queries ("how do puzzles work") retrieved wrong/generic content
- ⚠️ "What does Blinding Flash do" hit the wrong page (boss move vs skill)

### Infrastructure Note
- `/Grappling` wiki page redirects to `crimsondesertgame.wiki.fextralife.com` (different subdomain) — the overview page produces sparse chunks. Individual grappling skill pages (via BFS from the redirect) are correctly ingested.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-09 (Challenges Ingestion, Retrieval Fixes, 2-Phase Pipeline)

### Content
- **Challenges category added** — Crawled and ingested the Fextralife Challenges page (`/Challenges`) with all 5 tabs: Exploration, Mastery, Combat, Life, Minigame. ~78 individual challenge pages ingested (e.g. Feather of the Earth, location, unlock method, objective, reward).
- Added `challenges` to `CATEGORIES` in `scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts` with `contentType: "mechanic"`, `spoilerLevel: 2`, and `/Challenges` to `NAV_PAGES`.

### RAG Retrieval Fixes (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Classifier — challenge keywords**: Added `challenge|challenges|mastery|minigame|mini-game` to the mechanic regex in `classifyContentType()`. Challenge questions were previously falling through to a null classifier (no content_type filter), causing weak unfiltered vector search.
- **URL-match boost — case-insensitive for lowercase questions**: Replaced the uppercase-first letter filter on `boostKeywords` with a stop-word filter (`Set` of common English stop words). Previously, a question like "how to do feather of the earth challenge" produced zero boost keywords because none started with a capital letter, falling back to pure vector search. Now any word >3 chars not in the stop list is used as a boost term.
- **URL-match boost — `cleanedForPhrase` extraction**: Added logic to strip common question prefixes ("how to do", "where is", "what is", etc.) and topic suffixes ("challenge", "quest", "boss", etc.) from the raw question to extract the core multi-word topic name. "how to do feather of the earth challenge" → "feather of the earth" → URL-match fires correctly against `/Feather+of+the+Earth`.
- **TypeScript fix**: Explicitly typed `quotedNames` as `string[]` (was inferred as `RegExpMatchArray` which has a `readonly`-like `push` type of `never`). Caused a Vercel build failure on the first deploy of the above fix. Fix: `const quotedNames: string[] = question.match(...) || [];`

### Infrastructure
- **2-phase crawl+ingest pipeline**: Split the monolithic `ingest-fextralife.ts` into two scripts:
  - `scripts/crawl-wiki.ts` — crawls Fextralife wiki, saves extracted text as JSON to `wiki-cache/pages/{category}/` with a `manifest.json` index. Supports `--deep`, `--changed-only`, `--category`, `--dry-run`.
  - `scripts/ingest-from-cache.ts` — reads from `wiki-cache/`, chunks, generates Voyage AI embeddings, upserts to Supabase. Maintains `wiki-cache/ingest-state.json` to track what's already been embedded. Supports `--changed-only`.
  - `wiki-cache/` added to `.gitignore`.
  - Full deep crawl of all categories kicked off (PID 30320) — results will populate `wiki-cache/` for future re-ingests without re-crawling.

### Deployment
- Deployed via `git push origin main` (Vercel git integration). Vercel CLI token was expired; git integration works reliably.
- Build confirmed READY at commit `ae2364c` (retrieval fixes) and `0c544f4` (pipeline scripts).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-05 (Prompt Tuning, DB Cleanup, Item Location Supplement)

### Database Cleanup
- **Removed 72,702 duplicate chunks** (same source_url + same content from multiple ingest runs). DB went from 99,045 → 26,343 unique chunks.
- **Removed 9,527 nav-list junk chunks** (sidebar `♦ item1 ♦ item2...` lists). DB went from 26,343 → 16,816 real content chunks.
- **Added 529 "How to Obtain / Where to Find" chunks** for items via new `scripts/supplement-item-locations.ts`. Captures location, vendor, crafting, and boss-drop acquisition methods that the main crawler missed.

### Prompt Tuning (Full Pass)
- **System prompt rewritten** with game world context (Pywel, Kliff, Greymanes, 5 regions, combat systems). Claude now sounds knowledgeable about Crimson Desert instead of generic.
- **Key instruction**: "Extract and share EVERY useful detail — locations mentioned in descriptions, stats, related quests. If a description says 'hidden beneath the ruins of X', that IS location info — surface it."
- **Partial match handling**: "If context has relevant info but doesn't fully answer, share what you have and say what's missing" — prevents Claude from discarding useful partial context.
- **Context now includes `[Source: PageName]` metadata** per chunk so Claude knows where info came from.

### Nudge Tier Tightened
- Explicit rules: no button inputs, no phase breakdowns, no step-by-step instructions, no exact stat numbers
- Good/bad examples added to calibrate Claude's output
- Reduced from 3 chunks + 150 tokens to 2 chunks + 100 tokens (less context = less temptation to over-share)

### No-Info Responses Rewritten
- Removed "man up and figure it out yourself" and "Skill issue" — replaced with helpful suggestions to rephrase or try specific topics
- Scope explainer updated

### Classifier Fixes
- Moved skill/mechanic check BEFORE item — "Focused Shot skill" now routes to mechanic (was boss)
- Added location nouns to exploration regex: camp, ranch, gate, basin, falls, grotto, ridge, beacon — "How do I get to Greymane Camp?" now routes to exploration (was null)
- Added boss names: White Horn, Stoneback Crab, Taming Dragon
- Added NPC names: Matthias, Shakatu, Myurdin, Naira, Yann, Grundir
- Added grapple, observation, abyss artifact to mechanic keywords

### Voyage Embedding Fix
- Changed query embedding `input_type` from `"document"` to `"query"` — correct vector space for search queries

### Deployment Fixes
- Fixed Vercel deploy failures: Node.js 24.x → 20.x, reconnected git repo from `crimson-guide` to `gamehelper`
- Vercel Hobby plan doesn't support git-triggered deploys from collaborators; use `npx vercel --prod` from CLI

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-04 (Starter Question Retrieval Fixes)

### Fixed
Four homepage starter questions were not returning correct results. Root causes found via `scripts/debug-starters-full-pipeline.ts`:

- **Classifier misroute on "how do I solve X"** — `/how do/` in the mechanic regex was swallowing location/exploration questions. Azure Moon Labyrinth was routed to `mechanic` → filter missed the page entirely (top 5 became unrelated "Challenges" chunks). **Fix**: moved exploration regex *above* mechanic; added `labyrinth|ruin|tower|temple|crypt|catacomb|sanctum|dungeon|cave` and `how do i (solve|complete|clear|finish)` keywords to exploration; removed bare `how do`/`how does` from mechanic (kept the more specific `how does .+ work` phrasing).
- **Possessive-apostrophe regex bug in URL-match boost** — `quotedNames = /[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+/g` couldn't match "Saint's Necklace" or "Kailok's Lair" because the `'s` broke the second-word boundary. URL boost never fired for these questions; vector search returned semantically near-but-wrong items (Crossroads Necklace instead of Saint's Necklace). **Fix**: regex now tolerates possessive `'s`: `/[A-Z][a-z]+(?:'s)?(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:'s)?)+/g`.
- **URL-match boost too weak** — baseline similarity 0.55 + 0.15 rerank boost = 0.70 final. Filtered vector searches often return unrelated results at sim 0.78–0.90 (semantic near-misses), so URL-matched chunks from the *actually-named page* would lose the rerank. **Fix**: baseline 0.55 → **0.88**, rerank boost 0.15 → **0.25**. When the user explicitly names a page in their question, that page now dominates over any semantic drift.

### Results (measured via `scripts/debug-starters-full-pipeline.ts`)
All 4 starter questions now retrieve the correct page in the top-5 with similarity ≥ 1.0:
- "How do I solve the Azure Moon Labyrinth?" — was returning "Challenges" page, now returns Azure Moon Labyrinth (sim 1.13)
- "Best strategy for Kailok the Hornsplitter?" — already worked; slightly better (now Kailok wiki page 1.01 instead of YouTube transcripts)
- "Where is the Saint's Necklace?" — was returning **Crossroads Necklace (wrong item!)**, now returns Saint's Necklace (sim 1.13)
- "How does the Abyss Artifact system work?" — already worked; now hits the dedicated `/Abyss+Artifact` page instead of the `/Sealed+Abyss+Artifacts` spillover page

### DB admin task completed (2026-04-04)
Dropped the duplicate `match_knowledge_chunks` RPC overload. Ran in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
DROP FUNCTION public.match_knowledge_chunks(vector, double precision, integer);
```
Note: the actual stored signature uses `vector` without an explicit dimension (per `pg_proc.pg_get_function_identity_arguments`), not `vector(1024)` — had to match the stored form exactly. Verified via re-query of `pg_proc` — only the 4-arg version (with `content_type_filter text`) remains. The unfiltered-retry fallback path and `null`-classifier path now work cleanly — no more `Could not choose the best candidate function` errors from PostgREST.

### Regression check
Re-ran `scripts/test-rag-quality.ts` full suite after fixes: **42/59 (71.2%)**, avg sim 0.774 — identical pass rate to pre-fix baseline. No regressions. The starter-question fixes target URL-explicit proper-noun queries, which aren't in the test suite.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-04 (Two-Tier Spoiler System + No-Info Scope Explainer)

### Changed
- **Collapsed spoiler tiers from 3 to 2**: `nudge` (gentle hint, Haiku) + `full` (complete answer, Sonnet). Dropped the middle `guide` tier — its step-by-step formatting guidance was merged into the new `full` prompt.
  - `SpoilerTierSelector` now renders two buttons: "Nudge" and "Solution" (formerly "Full Solution"). The "Guide 📖" option is gone.
  - `SpoilerTier` type in `src/lib/supabase.ts` narrowed to `"nudge" | "full"`.
  - `TIER_CLAUDE` map in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` has 2 entries. `SPOILER_INSTRUCTIONS` has 2 prompts. Full prompt absorbed Guide's mobile-scannable formatting (bold key actions, numbered steps, no filler).
  - Chat API default tier changed from `"guide"` to `"nudge"` (cheapest, preserves discovery).
  - Legacy compatibility: incoming requests with `spoilerTier="guide"` are silently mapped to `"full"` at the top of the POST handler so cached clients don't break.
- **Admin dashboard** folds legacy `guide` query rows into the `full` count. Tier breakdown chart now shows 2 bars (Solution, Nudge). `/api/admin/stats` returns `{ nudge, full }` instead of `{ nudge, guide, full }`.
- **`ChatMessage` tier badge** map updated — 2 entries only.

### Added
- **Scope explainer in no-info fallback responses**: when retrieval returns nothing relevant (or Claude judges context irrelevant), the snarky line is now followed by a structured "What I'm built for" block explaining the app's strengths (boss strategies, weapon/armor stats, skill details, NPC info, region directions) with 4 example queries and a note about broad-overview question limitations. Applied in both the API short-circuit (`SCOPE_EXPLAINER` constant) and the `BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` / nudge `SPOILER_INSTRUCTIONS` so Claude emits the same block when it decides to fall back.

### Rationale
The Guide and Full tiers were producing nearly indistinguishable output in practice — both were walkthroughs at slightly different token budgets. Users couldn't tell which to pick. Collapsing to Nudge (hint) + Solution (answer) gives a clearer mental model and cleaner free→premium paywall split, and removes a prompt to maintain.

### Migration
- **DB**: no schema change. Historical `queries.spoiler_tier = 'guide'` rows are preserved; they're treated as `full` at read time.
- **Type/prompt files**: `route.ts`, `supabase.ts`, `SpoilerTierSelector.tsx`, `ChatMessage.tsx`, `admin/page.tsx`, `admin/stats/route.ts` all updated. Typecheck passes.

---

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-04 (Full Reseed Complete + RAG Quality Baseline)

### Completed
- **Full knowledge base reseed** across all 17 categories using `--deep` 2-level BFS + chunk-overlap format. Total: **82,312 chunks**. All categories ingested between 2026-04-03 16:47 and 17:46 UTC.
- Per-content-type avg chunk lengths confirm overlap format applied: boss 429, quest 280, item 519 (down from pre-overlap 666), exploration 458, mechanic 482, recipe 468, character 299.

### Measured
- **RAG quality baseline**: 42/59 test cases pass (71.2%), avg similarity 0.777. Strong (100%) in bosses, enemies, armor, abyss-gear, accessories, collectibles, locations, characters, npcs. Weak: items (25%), walkthrough (33%), guides (33% — category has only 2 chunks, crawler issue).

### Fixed
- **`scripts/test-rag-quality.ts`**: was calling the old `match_chunks` RPC instead of `match_knowledge_chunks` — the test suite couldn't run at all until fixed.

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-03 (Chunk Splitting & Overlap)

### Changed
- **`chunkPageContent()`** in `scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts` now uses sliding-window overlap:
  - `CHUNK_SPLIT_AT = 800` — sections over this are split into sub-chunks
  - `CHUNK_TARGET = 500` — target chars per sub-chunk
  - `CHUNK_OVERLAP = 150` — chars carried forward between intra-section sub-chunks so adjacent chunks share context
  - `INTER_OVERLAP = 120` — last ~120 chars of the previous section prepended to the next section's first chunk
- Added `splitWithOverlap()` helper — finds natural break points (paragraph → sentence → line → word) before splitting
- Added `sectionTail()` helper — extracts a clean word-boundary-aligned tail for inter-section overlap prefix
- Extracted `makeChunkMeta()` to DRY up chunk construction

### Why it matters
- Item chunks were averaging 666 chars with 303 over 1500 chars — one embedding had to represent a wall of stats
- After this change, long item pages produce multiple focused sub-chunks each with a specific concept (obtain → craft → stats → notes)
- Cross-section facts (e.g. a stat mentioned in the notes of the previous section) are now captured in the overlap prefix of the next chunk

### Note
Requires a full re-ingest to apply to existing chunks. Already-running ingest for remaining categories will use the new chunking automatically.

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-03 (RAG Metadata Pre-filtering)

### Added
- **`classifyContentType(question)`** in chat route — keyword + regex classifier mapping questions to 7 content types: `boss`, `item`, `quest`, `exploration`, `mechanic`, `recipe`, `character`. Returns `null` for ambiguous questions (no filter applied).
- **`content_type_filter TEXT DEFAULT NULL`** param in `match_knowledge_chunks` RPC — adds `AND kc.content_type = content_type_filter` to the WHERE clause so pgvector scores only the relevant chunk subset.
- **Automatic unfiltered fallback** — if filtered search returns 0 results (item living in an unexpected category), route retries without the filter before falling back to keyword search.

### Why it helps
- Boss fight questions search ~400 chunks instead of 6000+ — faster, less noise to Claude
- Item questions search ~3000 chunks (all gear types)
- No regression risk: zero-result filtered searches always fall back to full corpus

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-02 (Error Dashboard Time Filters)

### Added
- **`/api/admin/errors` endpoint**: Dedicated error log API accepting `?window=1h|24h|7d`. Returns filtered error list (up to 200), breakdown by type, and time-series bucketed data (5-min buckets for 1h, 1-hr buckets for 24h, 6-hr buckets for 7d).
- **Error Dashboard time filter UI** in `/admin`:
  - **1h / 24h / 7d toggle buttons** — switches window, auto-refetches
  - **Sparkline bar chart** — shows error frequency over time for selected window using appropriate bucket sizes
  - **Type breakdown cards** — one card per error type with count, % of total, and colored progress bar
  - **Expandable error rows** — click any row to expand full context (JSON prettified), stack trace (scrollable), and exact timestamp + IP
  - **Refresh button** — manual refresh without switching windows
  - Auto-fetches errors on login and whenever window changes

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-02 (Error Boundaries & Logging)

### Added
- **`error_logs` Supabase table**: Captures `error_type`, `message`, `stack`, `context` (jsonb), `client_ip`, `created_at`. Indexed on `created_at DESC` and `error_type`.
- **`/api/log-error` endpoint**: POST endpoint receives client-side errors and writes to `error_logs`. Truncates stack to 2000 chars, message to 500 chars. Never throws — designed to be fire-and-forget.
- **`src/lib/logError.ts`**: Client-side `logClientError()` utility. Wraps the fetch in try/catch so it never crashes the app.
- **`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`**: React class component (`componentDidCatch`) with a gaming-themed "Something went wrong / Try again" fallback UI. Logs error type, message, stack, component name, and component stack to `error_logs` via `logClientError`.
- **`src/app/error.tsx`**: Next.js App Router global error page — catches server component failures, logs them on mount, shows a themed error screen with "Try again" button and error digest ref.
- **Server-side error logging in `/api/chat`**: Outer catch block, Voyage AI errors, and Claude API errors all write to `error_logs` asynchronously (non-blocking).
- **Admin dashboard — Error Log section**: "Recent Errors (last 30)" table with colored type badges (`client_render`=yellow, `api_chat`=red, `voyage`=purple, `claude`=blue, `unhandled`=orange), message, compact JSON context, IP, and time ago. New "Errors (24h)" stat card in overview grid.

### Modified
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — wrapped `{children}` in `<ErrorBoundary componentName="RootLayout">` so any render crash shows a graceful fallback instead of a white screen.
- `src/app/api/admin/stats/route.ts` — added `recentErrors` (last 30 rows) and `errorsLast24h` count to parallel queries and response payload.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-02 (Admin CSV Export)

### Added
- **`/api/admin/export` route**: Protected by `ADMIN_SECRET` Bearer token. Accepts `?type=waitlist` or `?type=users` and returns a properly formatted `.csv` download with `Content-Disposition` header.
  - `waitlist` export: `email, signed_up_at` — all waitlist signups ordered newest first
  - `users` export: `id, email, tier, queries_today, signed_up_at` — all registered users
  - Values with commas/quotes/newlines are properly escaped per RFC 4180
- **Export buttons on `/admin` dashboard**: "↓ Waitlist CSV" (green) and "↓ Users CSV" (blue) buttons in the header — click to instantly download the CSV. Uses browser `Blob` + anchor click trick so no new tab opens.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-02 (Automated Wiki Monitoring)

### Added
- **`page_hashes` Supabase table**: Stores `sha256(content)[0:16]` per crawled URL + category. Enables change detection between runs.
- **`--changed-only` flag**: Before embedding, the script hashes each page's content and compares against `page_hashes`. Unchanged pages are skipped entirely — no Voyage API call, no DB write. Only new/changed pages get re-embedded and re-inserted.
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/wiki-reseed.yml`):
  - Runs every Sunday at 3am UTC with `--changed-only` (only processes changed wiki pages)
  - Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI with options for `--deep` and `--category`
  - Reads secrets: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VOYAGE_API_KEY`
- **CI-safe env loading**: Ingestion script now wraps `.env.local` read in try/catch and falls back to `process.env` — works in GitHub Actions without the file.

### Setup required
Add these three secrets to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VOYAGE_API_KEY`

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02 (Deeper Wiki Ingestion)

### Changed
- **New categories added**: `abyss-gear` (`/Abyss+Gear`), `npcs` (`/NPCs`), `collectibles` (`/Collectibles`), `key-items` (`/Key+Items`), `accessories` (`/Accessories`) — these were all missing from the ingestion script. Abyss Gear was also in the nav exclusion set, so it was actively blocked.
- **2-level BFS crawl** (`--deep` flag): Index page → Level-1 pages → Level-2 pages (links found within Level-1 pages). Discovers interconnected content that index pages don't link to directly (e.g., gear obtainable from a quest, crafted from an enemy drop, etc.).
- **Idempotent re-runs**: Before inserting, the script now deletes existing chunks by `source_url`. Re-running a category cleans and replaces without duplicating.
- **`extractLinks` / `extractLinksFromIndex` merged**: Single function used for both index and content pages.
- **NAV_PAGES exclusion updated**: Removed `/Abyss+Gear`, `/NPCs`, `/Collectibles`, `/Key+Items` from exclusion — these are now explicit crawl targets.

### To re-seed the database
```bash
# Just the missing categories (fast, targeted)
npx tsx scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts --category abyss-gear
npx tsx scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts --category npcs
npx tsx scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts --category collectibles

# Full re-seed with deep crawl (slow but comprehensive)
npx tsx scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts --deep
```

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-02 (Default Spoiler Tier)

### Changed
- **Default spoiler tier set to "nudge"**: New users start with the least spoilery experience instead of "guide".

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-02 (Mobile UX Fix)

### Fixed
- **Input above fold on mobile**: Replaced `h-screen` (`100vh`) with `h-[100dvh]` (dynamic viewport height). `100vh` includes mobile browser chrome (address bar, nav bar), pushing the input just below the visible area. `dvh` respects the actual visible viewport.
- **Header padding tightened on mobile**: `py-2 sm:py-4` saves ~16px vertical space on small screens.
- **Subtitle hidden on mobile**: "AI-powered game companion" tagline hidden on small screens (`hidden sm:block`) to recover space.
- **Page scroll locked**: Added `height: 100%` + `overflow: hidden` to `html`/`body` so the flex layout stays locked and the page doesn't scroll outside the container.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-02 (Cost Optimizations)

### Changed
- **Per-tier Claude model**: Nudge tier now uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (150 max tokens, 3 chunks) instead of Sonnet — ~20x cheaper per nudge query. Guide uses Sonnet at 600 tokens/6 chunks. Full uses Sonnet at 1024 tokens/8 chunks. Configured via `TIER_CLAUDE` constant.
- **Response caching**: Before calling Voyage AI or Claude, the API now checks the `queries` table for an identical `question` + `spoiler_tier` within the last 7 days. Cache hits skip all external API calls entirely.
- **Single Supabase client**: Merged `rateLimitDb` and `supabase` into one `createClient()` call per request.
- **Per-tier match count**: Vector search `match_count` is now 3/6/8 for nudge/guide/full respectively (was always 8).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-02 (Bug Fix + Admin)

### Fixed
- **Critical RAG bug**: `match_knowledge_chunks` Postgres function parameter was `vector` (untyped). When PostgREST casts a JSON float array to an untyped `vector`, Voyage `input_type: "query"` embeddings are silently corrupted — relevant chunks scored near-zero while unrelated chunks floated to the top. Fixed by changing parameter to `vector(1024)`.
- **Query embedding type**: Changed API route from `input_type: "query"` to `input_type: "document"` for Voyage AI. The "query" embedding space gets distorted through the PostgREST JSON→vector cast; "document" type passes through correctly and relevant chunks now score 0.6–0.85.
- **Vector search threshold**: Raised from `0.0` to `0.5` in both the RPC call and the `hasRelevantContext` check. With correct embeddings, relevant content scores > 0.6 and unrelated content scores < 0.4, so 0.5 cleanly separates them.
- **match_count**: Increased from 5 to 8 to give Claude more context per query.

### Added
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`): Password-gated analytics page showing overview stats (total queries, today, users, premium, waitlist, tokens), 7-day query bar chart, spoiler tier usage breakdown, knowledge base chunk counts by type, and recent queries table (last 50). Protected by `ADMIN_SECRET` env var.
- **Admin API** (`/api/admin/stats`): Aggregates data from `queries`, `users`, `waitlist`, and `knowledge_chunks` tables via 10 parallel Supabase queries.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01 (Feature Sprint)

### Added
- **Signup cap + waitlist**: Limits signups to 100 users (configurable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_USERS`). When full, shows waitlist email form that saves to `waitlist` table in Supabase.
- **Rate limiting**: IP-based, server-side. Free: 5/min, 20/hr. Premium: 10/min, 60/hr. Friendly messages shown inline in chat. Uses `client_ip` column on `queries` table with index.
- **Google AdSense integration**: `AdBanner` component (horizontal + rectangle formats), `UpgradeCTA` component. Banner ad after every 3rd response, upgrade CTA every 5th, desktop sidebar ad (300x250). Premium users see zero ads. AdSense script lazy-loaded in layout.
- **Fextralife wiki ingestion script** (`scripts/ingest-fextralife.ts`): Crawls 12 wiki categories, extracts content, chunks by heading sections, generates Voyage AI embeddings, upserts to Supabase. Supports `--dry-run` and `--category` flags.
- **Knowledge base seeded**: 1,690 chunks from Fextralife wiki across all categories:
  - Bosses: 38 | Quests: 222 | Weapons: 389 | Armor: 244
  - Skills: 165 | Items: 95 | Locations: 191 | Characters: 89
  - Guides: 1 | Enemies: 12 | Crafting: 30 | Walkthrough: 214
- **Project tracking files**: PROJECT_STATUS.md, CHANGELOG.md, LEARNINGS.md, TODO_MANUAL.md for cross-machine development.
- **Supabase migrations**: `waitlist` table, `client_ip` column + index on `queries` table.

### Technical Decisions
- Used nav-page exclusion set for wiki link extraction to avoid crawling sidebar/header links from every page
- 1.5s delay between wiki requests to be respectful to Fextralife servers
- Batch embedding (32) and batch insert (50) for efficient ingestion
- AdSense only loads when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_ID` env var is set — zero impact when unconfigured

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-26 (Initial Build)

### Added
- **Next.js 16 project** scaffolded with App Router, React 19, TypeScript 6, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Chat UI** with dark gaming theme (custom CSS variables: crimson, gold, dark surfaces)
  - Message bubbles with user/assistant styling
  - Animated loading dots (pulse-glow keyframes)
  - Sample starter questions for new users
  - Custom scrollbar styling
- **Spoiler Tier System** with three levels:
  - **Nudge** - 1-2 sentence hints, no exact solutions
  - **Guide** - Step-by-step walkthrough (3-5 steps)
  - **Full Solution** - Complete detailed answer with all info
  - Each tier has a carefully crafted system prompt with examples of good/bad responses
- **RAG Pipeline** in `/api/chat/route.ts`:
  - Voyage AI `voyage-3.5-lite` for query embeddings
  - Supabase pgvector `match_knowledge_chunks` RPC for semantic search
  - Text-search fallback: keyword extraction (with stop words), ilike matching, ranked by keyword overlap
  - Relevance gating: similarity > 0.3 (vector) or >= 2 keyword matches (text) required
  - Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) for answer generation
  - Async query logging to Supabase `queries` table
- **Auth System** via Supabase Auth:
  - Email/password sign up and sign in
  - Google OAuth with redirect callback
  - AuthProvider React context with session management
  - User tier (free/premium) and daily query counter
- **Voice Features**:
  - Speech-to-text input via Web Speech API (Chrome/Edge)
  - Text-to-speech playback button on AI responses
- **Demo Mode** - Canned responses when API keys aren't configured
- **Snarky Fallbacks** - 5 randomized humorous responses when no relevant context found
- **Manual .env.local loader** in API route as workaround for Next.js 16 / Node 24 env loading

### Technical Decisions
- Used Voyage AI (`voyage-3.5-lite`) instead of OpenAI for embeddings — lighter, cheaper for this use case
- Chose Supabase over standalone Postgres for built-in auth, realtime, and pgvector support
- Built custom env loader in API route because Next.js 16 with Node 24 had issues loading .env.local in server routes
- Spoiler tier prompts are detailed with per-category examples (puzzles, items, bosses, mechanics) to prevent prompt leakage between tiers
